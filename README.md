# Wraith2D
A simple 2D game engine built with SDL2.

## How to build
This project is developed using Visual Studio 2019. To build it, simply open it in Visual Studio and build the solution.

## Disclaimer
This is just a fun project developed in two weeks as part of a coding challenge. 
While it can (and was used to) create small 2D games, it is by no means a finished (and completely bug-free) product.
